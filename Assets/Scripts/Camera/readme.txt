Camera2DController is a simple 2d camera controller that was originally designed for a shmup. Supports following a target(moves to keep it within a deadzone), switching between orienting to the target/world, and snaps its position to an invisible, configurable pixel grid(for pixel perfect camera alignment).

SplitscreenCamera is a script that can be applied to any cameras to make them render as splitscreen cameras. Simply apply to up to 4 cameras in a scene, set their camera number, and enable/disable them as needed. They will automatically change to accomodate 1/2/3/4 players with multiple configurable options for 2 and 3 player screen partitioning. Make sure to have a camera that renders a border for the background, or it will look kind of weird.
